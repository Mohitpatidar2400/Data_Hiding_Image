Research Paper Title -> Hiding Data Using Efficient Combination of RSA Cryptography, and Compression Steganography Techniques

This Research paper implementation describe the efficient way to transmit the information.

This project has Four components.

1. Encryption Decryption of text using Asymmetric key Cryptography Algorithm ( RSA )
2. Compression Decompression Encrypted text using Huffman coding.
3. Compression Decompression of cover image by Discrete Wavelet tranform algorithm (DWT)
4. Hide and retrieve Compress data into cover  image using LSB Steganography

To run the project

Install python library NumPy,PyDWT

1.Run app.py to compress the cover image size.
2.Run main1.py to hide the data into image.
